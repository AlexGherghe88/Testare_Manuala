<h1>Testing Project for <Inserati aici numele aplicatiei pe care o testati> </h1>

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and aplly them in practice, using a live application

Application under test: JpetStore Demo

Tools used: Jira, Zephyr Squad.

Functional specifications
The below story was created in Jira and describes the functional specifications of the "Product" module, for which the final project is performed upon.

story

1 Testing section
1.1 Test planning
The Test Plan is designed to describe all details of testing for all the modules from the JPetStore Demo application.

The plan identifies the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the types of testing to be performed, the personnel responsible for testing, the resources and schedule required to complete testing, and the risks associated with the plan

Roles asigned to the project and persons allocated

Project manager - Andrei Popescu
Product owner - Madalina Gheorghe
Software developer - Gabriel Tomescu
QA Engineer - Adina Anghel
1.1.2 Entry criteria defined

functional specifications are defined
roles needed for the project are allocated
initial project risks were detected and mitigated
test schedule is prepared.
testing environment is up and running.
test data should be available to cover the different scenarios and use cases that will be tested.
1.1.3 Exit criteria defined

number of unresolved bugs is insignificant or they have low priority
all tests have been executed
all resolved bugs have been re-tested and approved by the QA team
deadline was reached
no detected major risk remained un-mitigated
all required documentation, including test plans, test cases, and test results, has been completed and reviewed.
95% of tests are passed.
no Critical issues have Open status
1.1.4 Test scope

Tests in scope:

To design a user-friendly interface that allows customers to browse and search for products easily.
To provide photos for each product so the customers will know what they are gonna purchased.
To add a variety of pets so you can have from where to choose from.
Compatible with all most used browsers and old versions of Android and iOS.
Tests not in scope:

Non-functional testing like stress, accessibility, performance is beyond scope of this project.
Automation testing is beyond scope.
1.1.5 Risks detected

Project risks:

Poor communication and collaboration between team members, stakeholders or external suppliers can lead to misunderstandings, delays and rework.

Lack of Testing: Insufficient testing can result in undiscovered bugs and issues that may surface after the site's launch.

Lack of user involvement: Inadequate user feedback and involvement during the development process can result in a site that does not meet users' needs.

Budget Overruns: Unexpected expenses can strain the project budget, potentially requiring trade-offs in features or quality.

Product risks:

Payment Processing Issues: If there are any flaws in the payment processing system, it could lead to financial losses for both the customers and the business. Issues like transaction failures or unauthorized access to payment details are significant concerns.
Management of returns and refunds: Complicated handling of returns and refunds might result in irate customers and monetary losses.
Reputation Management: Negative reviews or social media backlash due to any of the above issues can harm the reputation of the business.
Website performance: Poor website performance, such as long loading times or problems, can annoy visitors and cost businesses sales.
1.1.6 Evaluating entry criteria

The entry criterias defined in the Test Planning phase have been achieved and the test process can continue.

1.2 Test Monitoring and Control
1.3 Test Analysis
The testing process will be executed based on the above requirements for the Products module. The following test conditions were found:

-Verify that images of products are displayed correctly.

-Verify that the prices are displayed correctly.

-Verify the search bar functionality when using a valid value.

-Verify that production stock information are displayed.

1.4 Test Design
Functional test cases were created in Zephyr Squad. Based on the analysis of the specifications, the test design techniques used for generating test cases are boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning and use case testing.

Test cases: Test cases

The test cases with steps can be viewed here: JPetStore_test_cases.pdf

1.5 Test Implementation
The following elements are needed to be ready before the test execution phase begins:

Testing environment is up and running: JPetStore
Access to the testing environment is given: Username : Adina2711 | Password : Anaaremere23!
Cycle summary was created
Test cases were added to the cycle summary
1.6 Test Execution
Test cases are executed on the created test Cycle summary: JPetStore_cycle_summary_execution.pdf

Bugs have been created based on the failed tests. The complete bug reports can be found here: JPetStore_created_bugs.pdf

Full regression testing is needed after the bugs are fixed

1.7 Test Completion
As the Exit criteria were met and satisfied as mentioned in the appropriate section, this feature is suggested to ‘Go Live’ by the Testing team
The traceability matrix was generated and can be found here: Traceability_matrix.csv
Test execution chart was generated, the final report shows that a number 10 tests have failed of a total of 30
A number of 30 test cases were planned for execution and all of them were executed
A number of 10 total bugs were found, from which the priority is: 2 are high and 8 are medium.
